# How to run code

### just run docker-compose up --build

# Note

### Might have some dependency issues with my docker configuration a little, so please let everything load for a few seconds (the SQL db needs to be fully started) before going to http://localhost

everything should be up and running once this is seen in the logs

```bash
Database init
Server running on http://localhost:3000
```
